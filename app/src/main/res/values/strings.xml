    students be able to notice the signs and symptoms of these mental illnesses and therefore prevent them. This
    app does NOT aim at replacing the services you receive from your doctor. Please seek help from your doctor as usual
    and use the Focus app as a compliment.</string>

        About Positive Confessions
    </string>
    <string name="about_positive_confessions">
        The words we speak carry enormous power to either make or break, build or destroy. The Bible in Proverbs 18:21
        says that death and life are in the power of the tongue, notice how the power is accredited to the tongue. It is
        therefore important that we speak the right things. The purpose of this section is to guide you on the kinds of
        things to say over yourself and your loved ones. All the confessions are taken from Bible verses and the verses
        are provided for personal reference and further study.
